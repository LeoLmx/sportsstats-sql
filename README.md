### Scenario

The course simulates you working at a fictitious company, as the course briefing cites:

You are a data scientist working for a data analytics firm. Your firm has explored a multitude of data sources. And is tasked with providing key insights that your clients can make actionable. Your manager has asked you to provide some data analytics guidance for one of the firm's clients. In a typical scenario you would work iteratively with your client to understand the data wanting to be analyzed. Having a solid understanding of the data and underlying assumptions present is crucial to the success of a data analysis project. However, in this case, you will need to do a little more of the heavy lifting. To begin, you will prepare a project proposal detailing the questions we are wanting to answer. The initial hypotheses about the data relationships and the approach you will take to get your answers.

The course is divided into Milestones:

1. **Milestone 1** - Data Analysis: Choose you dataset, your hypotheses and preliminarily data analysis.
2. **Milestone 2** - Descriptive Stats: First queries, answering your questions
3. **Milestone 3** - Beyond Descriptive Stats: Expanding your questions, new connections, Pearson Correlation
4. **Milestone 3** - Presenting Your Findings (Storytelling): This whole notebook will be the Milestone 3
